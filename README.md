# evilfactory ctf 2019

OK Welcome to the game.

To celebrate our independence day, lets having fun with some game

This is a basic CTF game which is you need to get
some flag that hidden in this code. If you see some common "cipher"
pattern here, you will know which cipher was used here :))

Something you need to do is only "realize" what cipher was used here
and what "key" to unlock the flag.
Basically the key was placed anywhere, so use your imagination.

Try to execute `verify(someKey)` if you have known the right "key".
